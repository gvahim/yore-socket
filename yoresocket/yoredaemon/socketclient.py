    A class that represents a YORE client.
    This class contains:
        (*) A socket that is used as an IPC mechanism to transfer control 
            packages and data.
        (*) Variables that keep track of the in/out data on this channel.
        
        (*) LOCKS! A lot of locks to keep everything synchronized.

            than once and we don't want to hang.
